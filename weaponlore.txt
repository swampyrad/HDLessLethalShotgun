Bernoulli M1053 Less-Lethal Shotgun
==================================
The Bernoulli M1053 is a semi-automatic shotgun specifically
designed for riot control and home defense. This shotgun has
been modified to chamber specially-made less-lethal shells 
that fire rubberized steel pellets. This allows for subduing 
hostile threats with a low margin of accidental death. This 
weapon is a holdover from the days when UAC wanted to 
avoid excessive force charges when dealing with disgruntled
staff employees. This changed once they arrived on Phobos. 
Far from the peering eyes of the law, it was easier to 'bury' 
any form of dissent, thus rendering this weapon a mere novelty, 
mainly being used for pranks by the more juvenile guards. 
However, it still has enough force to kill, given enough shots. 
Best used against unarmored targets.
